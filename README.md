# MACHINE LEARNING
# OVERVIEW
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning system is trained on a dataset to generalize patterns and make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.
# TASKS WHICH INCLUDE IN THE PROJECT
# Task 1:
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
# The following steps that I had taken to complete the above task 
1)Importing necessary Libraries<br>
2)Datasets are Loaded<br>
3)EDA & Visualization
4)Data preprocessing and text cleaning
5)Text Vectorization Using TF-IDF
6)Naive Bayes- Used of training the Model and Splitting the dataset
7)Predictions are marked on the Test Data
# Necessary Libraries That needs to installed before running the code
